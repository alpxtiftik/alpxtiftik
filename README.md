**Computer Engineering Student | 42 Istanbul Participant | IUCYBER President**

I am a third-year Computer Engineering student at Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa and a participant in the 42 Istanbul core curriculum. My focus is strictly on offensive security, Red Teaming operations, and system-level C programming. I combine academic theory with practical exploit development and low-level memory management.

### Current Focus & Status

* **System Programming:** Currently working on the **`libft`** project for 42 Istanbul, re-implementing standard C library functions to master memory allocation (`malloc`/`free`), pointer arithmetic, and void casting.
* **Cybersecurity:** President of **IUCYBER**. Actively solving CTF challenges (Binary Analysis, JWT attacks, Steganography) and following a structured learning path on TryHackMe.
* **Workflow:** I operate on a strict 50/10 block cycle (50 minutes deep work, 10 minutes rest).
* **Internship:** Completed a Cyber Security internship at **TAV Technologies** (Summer 2025), focusing on WAF/EDR analysis, Threat Modeling (STRIDE), and penetration testing.

### Technical Stack

* **Languages:** C (Current main focus), Python, JavaScript, Bash, HTML5/CSS3.
* **Security Tools:** Wireshark, Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, Kali Linux.
* **Systems:** Unix/Linux Internals, TCP/IP, DNS & SSL/TLS Configuration.
* **Methodologies:** Secure SDLC, Defense-in-Depth, OWASP Top 10.

    * Performed manual penetration testing (Business Logic Flaws, SQLi, XSS).
    * Managed vulnerability lifecycles and reporting.
* **Freelance Web Developer** (May 2024 - Present)
    * Deployed and managed **esualife.com** (Water purification business).
    * Handled full stack deployment: DNS, SSL/TLS, SEO, and hosting infrastructure.

### Offline

* **Strength Training:** I train approximately every other day, focusing on compound lifts (Dips, Barbell Rows, Deadlifts, Bench Press).
* **Interests:** Digital watches (Casio F-91W/AE-1200WH modding).
